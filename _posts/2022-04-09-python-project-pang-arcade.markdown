<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ython's <strong>pygame</strong> is a free library for game development.</p>

We will learn the functions of pygame by creating a simple version of Pang which is a retro arcade game. Pang is a game in which a gamer moves a character from side to side, avoiding balloons, and firing weapons to eliminate balloons.

### Pygame Installation

First, open a terminal window in VS Code and run `pip install pygame`. If we can see a statement "Successfully installed pygame," it means that the installation has been done well. It is very simple and easy.

To be more clearly, let's create a test file to make sure that the installation is completed well. Import pygame, and press the triangle button in the upper right to run the file. If it runs well without any errors, we can go to the next step.
